Hi!

This was my final project for ECE319K. We built a Space Invaders game using an ST7735 Display, a slide potentiometer, an MSPM0+ microcontroller board, and four switches. 
The game has two levels, but could be optimized to create more and potentially with random enemies. 
Here is a video demonstration:

Thank you for viewing!
